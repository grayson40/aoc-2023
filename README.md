# Advent of Code 2023 Solutions

Welcome to my repository containing my solutions for the Advent of Code 2023! This is my first year participating in this exciting and challenging coding event.

## About Advent of Code

Advent of Code is an annual set of Christmas-themed programming challenges that can be solved in any programming language you like. It's a great way to improve your coding skills and have fun solving different types of problems.

## Repository Structure

This repository is organized by days, with each day's challenge having its own folder. Inside each folder, you'll find the code for the solution along with the input needed to solve the problem.

```
/
├── day-1
│   ├── main.py
│   └── input.txt
├── day-2
│   ├── main.py
│   └── input.txt
├── ...
```

## My Goals

As this is my first year, my primary goals are:

- To learn and improve my problem-solving skills.

- To get familiar with new algorithms and data structures.

- To consistently participate and try to solve as many challenges as I can.

## Technologies Used

I'll be primarily using Python for solving the challenges due to its simplicity and readability. However, I might experiment with other languages as I progress.

## Contributions

While I'm aiming to solve these challenges on my own, suggestions and tips are always welcome! Feel free to open an issue or a pull request if you see an opportunity for improvement.

## Stay Updated

I'll be updating this repository daily with new solutions. So, stay tuned!
